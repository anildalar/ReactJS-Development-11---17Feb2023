How we can load these component with URL pattern?

URL = Uniform Resource Location

http://localhost:3000

We have to introduce what is called

Routes

http://localhost:3000/routes

Base Address
http://localhost:3000

Base Address/Routes
Base Address/someRouteName


http://localhost:3000

For example we have to create 
2 Pages
1. Login
2. Register

http://localhost:3000/login ---> Login.js
http://localhost:3000/regsiter ---> Register.js

react-router-dom is a 3rd party library

In order to download any 3rd party libary in nodejs

nodejs -> npm (node package manager)


http://localhost:3000/
BaseAddress/ -> Home.js
BaseAddress/login -> Login.js
BaseAddress/register -> Register.js

Every nodejs 3rd party library are download from https://www.npmjs.com/

npm install <libraryName> --save

react-router-dom 6.8.1
